# asnames

Naming of Autonomous System numbers is an issue. Info one can get out of RIR databases ("whois") is quite messy.

This repo contains my curated list of names for when other sources fail to give me a good descriptive name.

These names work for me, and I hope they are useful to others.

I try to make the names short but descriptive. Happy with pull requests, but in the end, I decide over the curation.
