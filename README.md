# asnames

Naming of Autonomous System numbers is an issue. Info one can get out of RIR databases ("whois") is quite messy.

This repo contains a curated list of names for when other sources fail to give a good descriptive name. It is in the asnames.csv file.
This is a pipe( | )-delimited file with 3 fields:
   * ASN (I tried to keep the list ordered)
   * contributor: github ID of the person contributing the name
   * as name: The name for this ASN (according to the contributor)

It is possible that multiple names appear for a single ASN. In that case it's up to you to decide for the logic. 

A few suggestions: Either you prefer a contributor, or you pick the first name that you find.

I've added 'alternative' (for instance shorter, but less descriptive) names so you can experiment with this.

For contributors: If you think your name is better then all other names listed already, please put it above the other names for the same AS (but keep the ASNs numerically ordered)
