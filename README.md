# asnames

Naming of Autonomous System numbers is an issue. Info one can get out of RIR databases ("whois") is quite messy.

This repo contains a curated list of names for when other sources fail to give a good descriptive name. It is in the asnames.csv file.
This is a tab-separated file with 3 fields:
   * ASN (I tried to keep the list ordered)
   * contributor: github ID of the person contributing the name
   * as name: The name for this ASN (according to the contributor)

It is possible that multiple names appear for a single ASN. In that case it's up to you to decide for the logic. A few suggestions: Either you prefer a contributor, or you pick the first name that you find.
